We are not saying that Russian hackers and Russian spies helped Trump defeat Hilary Clinton.  That is a complicated question which is not easy to answer.  We are still going through the piles of evidence and comparing it to spycraft (which we of course know nothing about). But, we have heard the arguments in favor of the spying case and are here to write a quick nonspy article from the perspective of one who thinks that the Russians did in fact help Trump.  Here it goes..

The president himself colluded with the Russians.  The president knew the Russians were seeking to help him. So he went out as a candidate, invited them to hack more, did not tell his family not to take any of these meetings, was told by Roger Stone that WikiLeaks, a Russian cut-out, was also going to be putting out materials damaging to his opponent, and he went on the stage and said, "I lover WikiLeaks." This is circumstantial evidence which in a court of law can be treated as the same as direct evidence. Yes, he colluded. I don't think that's a hard question to answer at all. 

Adam Schiff said there's no direct evidence that the president of the United States ordered these things. In other words, that he directly colluded, but it's all circumstantial. I believe there's circumstantial evidence that he colluded. He knew they were doing this. His family was meeting with them. Offers being made. It was being passed to him. He would publicly go out and encourage them to do it. Who would be so dumb to invite the Russians to do it on a national stage, exception to colluding? There's direct evidence. His invitation for them to hack more. That's direct evidence of inviting them to collude.

That idea of collusion or conspiracy is the heart of what Robert Mueller has been investigating. There's a difference between criminal collusion or whether the guy did it or not.  Everyone in Washington thinks the full report is coming soon, whether that's days or weeks. There's a belief it's going be issued to the DOJ, some discretion as to what will be released. The belief that the White House will invoke executive privilege to keep some of it from being made public. What can you and the House Democrats do to ensure that the public learns what Robert Mueller discovers?

We will see that Mueller report. I say that with confidence. For two years we went to the streets, town squares, marched on the ballot box. The American people gave us the power to see that report. The president is now outnumbered, Congress just voted 420-0 to see the report. And the law is on their side. We have the legislative and judicial branch to back us up if he tries to block that report.  This president has been given an opportunity to sit down and say to special counsel under oath, "I did not collude." He won't do that. I infer from that, and the overwhelming evidence, and the state of evidence from others who said he did know Russians were doing that, that he does have something to hide.

So, there you have it nonspies... We will evaluate and present the other side soon!
