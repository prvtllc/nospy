excerpt: Though Kersey admits theres no telling for certain whether the app can be compromised, West Virginia is undeterred, especially given the really good response rate officials saw during the midterms last year. We are not saying mobile voting is the best solution to the problem, we are not saying that blockchain technology is the best solution to storage of security data, Kersey tells LongHash.

We have been discussing the Donald [Trump Russia spying scandal.](https://www.nonspy.com/blog/if-we-believed-russia-helped-trump/)  Now, we got a new one... Good intentions ti allow military members stationed overseas to vote via blockchain!!  Sure, spies have absolutely no idea how to breach this infrastructure, wink, wink...

Military voters stationed overseas will be able to cast their votes for the 2020 presidential election [via a mobile app that uses a private blockchain](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/613358/west-virginia-will-allow-blockchain-voting-in-the-2020-election-thats-a-risky/). MIT Technology Review reports:  Donald Kersey, West Virginia's elections director, [tells the cryto news website LongHash](https://www.longhash.com/news/west-virginia-will-use-blockchain-voting-in-the-2020-presidential-election-why) that he believes the app, created by a startup called Voatz, can enhance participation by overseas voters. Turnout among this group is very low, in part because the process of receiving a ballot and securely returning it on time is often not straightforward. This is the rationale behind the decision by a number of states to allow overseas military voters to return their ballots via e-mail. West Virginia apparently is of the mind that Voatz's private blockchain will make this kind of online voting more secure. The state first piloted the program during the 2018 midterms. 

Though Kersey admits there's no telling for certain whether the app can be compromised, West Virginia is undeterred, especially given the "really good response rate" officials saw during the midterms last year. "We are not saying mobile voting is the best solution to the problem, we are not saying that blockchain technology is the best solution to storage of security data," Kersey tells LongHash. "What we are saying though is that it's better than what we have."
